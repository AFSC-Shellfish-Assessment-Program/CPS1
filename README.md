# Collaborative Pot Sampling Winter/Spring 2023

The data from this project are public and shareable but will continue to be updated through this repository.  The number of red king crab caught per pot (CPUE) during sampling used red king crab pots which were modified (smaller mesh, and escapes closed) for a controlled soak time (~30 hrs) so comparisons with red king crab fishery CPUEs are relative.  Comparisons to NMFS summer trawl survey densities or distribution should note the substantial differences in methods, timing, and spatial coverage.  Interpretations of these data are limited to their representation as a 'first sampling' in one season (Mar 19 - Apr 4, 2023) across a core but incomplete portion of the Bristol Bay red king crab distribution.  The project should be referenced as "CPS1" - as the first Collaborative Pot Sampling winter-spring project for crab, and was supported primarily by ADFG and NMFS, in collaboration with BSFRF and ABSC.
